# 11.3-Insertion-Sort

**Java Programming Assignment: Implementing Insertion Sort**

**Objective:**
Students will write a Java program to implement the Insertion Sort algorithm and apply it to sort an array of integers.

**Instructions:**
1. Write a Java program that implements the **insertionSort** method to sort an array in ascending order.
2. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of elements in the array and then the elements themselves.
3. Display the sorted array after applying the insertion sort algorithm.
4. Ensure the program follows best coding practices, including comments and meaningful variable names.

**Requirements:**
- The **insertionSort** method should be implemented using a loop-based approach.
- The method should take an integer array as a parameter and modify it in place.
- Display both the original and sorted arrays.

**Bonus (Optional Enhancements):**
- Modify the program to sort in **descending order**.
- Allow the user to choose between **ascending or descending order** before sorting.
- Implement the sorting algorithm using **recursion** instead of loops.
- Analyze and print the number of comparisons and swaps performed during the sorting process.
