# 11.3  Implementing Insertion Sort (Iterative & Recursive)**

**Objective:**
Students will write a Java program to implement the Insertion Sort algorithm using both iterative and recursive approaches and apply it to sort an array of integers.

**Instructions:**
1. Write a Java program that implements two versions of the **insertionSort** method:
   - One using **for and while loops** (iterative approach).
   - One using **recursion**.
2. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of elements in the array and then the elements themselves.
3. Display the sorted array after applying both insertion sort methods.
4. Ensure the program follows best coding practices, including comments and meaningful variable names.

**Requirements:**
- Implement two sorting methods:
  - `insertionSortIterative(int[] arr)`: Uses loops.
  - `insertionSortRecursive(int[] arr, int n)`: Uses recursion.
- Display both the original and sorted arrays.
