# 11.3-Insertion-Sort

**Objective:**
Students will implement the selection sort algorithm in Java and demonstrate its correctness by sorting an array of integers.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a Java class named SelectionSort.
2. Implement a static method selectionSort(int[] array) that sorts the array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.
3. The method should:
   - Find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array.
   - Swap it with the first unsorted element.
   - Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted elements.
4. Write a main method to:
   - Initialize an integer array with at least 10 unsorted values.
   - Call the selectionSort method.
   - Print the array before and after sorting.
5. Ensure proper formatting, meaningful variable names, and comments explaining each step.

**Method Modification**
Modify the selectionSort method to sort the array in descending order if a boolean parameter ascending is set to false.
